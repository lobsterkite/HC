If anyone has an a knack for writing i'd like help in building out the guild website.  I feel that it can take us to the next level as we prep for TBC! Qualifications include:
 - Strong english skills
 - Ability to differentiate between than vs then, their vs there, it's vs its, etc.
 - Abundant free time
 - Passion for purposeless work
I've built a strong foundation full of style and flair but it needs a bit of substance

Just wait for the monetization phase and you start seeing ad revenue kickbacks

It's not optomized for mobile, or anything really, so please use desktop for the best experience.
